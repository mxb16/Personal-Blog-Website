            <h2>Location & How to Get There</h2>
            Wadi Darbat is located in Dhofar region in Oman.<br> 
            The wadi is located only a few kilometers behind Taqa, 
            a beach city in Dhofar Region. It is located on the left
            side on the road to Tawi Atair. <br>
            From Taqa, there is a road sign to Wadi Darbat. Follow the
            tarmac road until you reach the end of the valley, but be
            careful that you cannot drive freely through the entire valley.<br>

            <h2>Significance of Wadi Darbat</h2>
            This wadi caves its way through hills and highlands
            until it reaches Khawr Ruri, where it empties into the Arabian Gulf. <br>
            During autumn, the wadi’s water descending from the mountains forms
            magnificent waterfalls cascading from a height of up to 30 meters
            (100 feet).<br>
            The wadi’s water plays as the source of the water of Teeq Cave’s cells.<br>
